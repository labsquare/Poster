# Slogan
Labsquare is a community of dedicated individuals focusing on development of simple and usable genomic software.

# Goal
Genomic technologies are constantly evolving. Today, humanity produces a large amount of data and bioinformatics has become crucial pillar of biology and medicine. Several free solutions already exist to process genomic data, but most of them are not user friendly, command line only applications and require advanced computer skills to operate. To help non-experts, enthusiasts and novices to analyze their data several commercial software offerings are already in development. Labsquare would like to be an alternative: a non-profit organization which produces simple and accessible, open source genomic UI oriented software for everyone.  

# Technology
We favour Qt framework - a GPL C++ framework which allows us to develop modern cross-platform applications. A lot of open source and commercial software packages are built on top of Qt.

# Community
So far we are just a small team, but all skills are present. We are bioinformaticians, geneticists, physicians, developers, and designers. Our open source projects are available on GitHub and we are talking on #Gitter.

# Licenses
All our software is available under GPLv3 license.

# Application examples

## FastQt
FastQt is a fast, clean and intuitive tool designed to process FASTQ files. We developed it from ground up and it's taking a lot of inspiration by the famous FastQC app.

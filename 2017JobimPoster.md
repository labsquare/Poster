# Slogan
Labsquare is a community of dedicated individuals focusing on development of simple and usable genomic software.

# Goal
Genomic technologies are constantly evolving. Today, we produce a large amount of data and bioinformatics has become crucial for biology and medicine. Several free solutions already exist to process genomic data, but most of them are not-so-user-friendly command-line applications and require advanced computer skills. To help non-experts to analyze their data, several commercial companies are already on the move and are seducing people with nice graphical user interfaces. Labsquare would like to be an alternative: a non-profit organization which produces simple and accessible open source genomic GUI software for everyone.  

# Technology
We are devotees of the Qt framework, a GPL C++ framework which allows us to develop modern cross-platform applications. As an example, Spotify and Mendeley are built on top of Qt.

# Community
We are actually a small team, but all skills are present. We are bioinformaticians, developers, physicians, geneticists and designers.
All our projects are available on GitHub and we are talking on #Gitter.

# Licenses
All our software is available under GPLv3 license.

# Application examples

## FastQt
FastQt is the first Labsquare application. It is a clone of the famous FastQC application developed in Java. It is a tool to process FASTQ files, get statistics and display plots.
You can test it and see how FastQt is different from the Java software.

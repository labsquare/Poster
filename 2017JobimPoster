#Slogan
Labsquare is a community for genomic software. It aims to develop software usable by everyone.

#Goal
New genomic technologies have advanced significantly. Today we produce a large amount of data and bioinformatics has become crucial for biology and medicine. Several free software already exist to process genomics data, but most of them are command-line application and require computer skills. To help non-expert to analyze their data, several commercial companies are already on the move and seduce people with nice graphic user interfaces.
Labsquare would like to be an alternative: a non-profit organization which produces simple and accessible open source genomic GUI software for everyone.  

#Technology
We are devotees of the Qt framework. A GPL C++ framework which helps us to develop modern cross-platform application. As an example, Spotify and Mendeley are built on top of Qt.

#Community
We are actually a small team, but all skills are present. We are bioinformaticians, developpers, physicians, geneticists and designers.
All projects are available on GitHub and we are talking on #Gitter.

#Licenses
All software are built under GPLv3 license.

# Application example

## FastQt
FastQt is the first Labsquare application. It is the clone of the famous FastQC application developed in Java. It is a tool to process FASTQ files, to get statistics and to display plots.
You can test it and see how FastQt is different from the Java.
